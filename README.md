# self_driving_car
This is my Code Clause internship project as an Artificial intelligence intern :- Self Driving Car
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The self-driving car project using Pygame, deep learning, and neural network involves training a model to
drive a car autonomously. Pygame is a Python library used for game development that provides tools for creating
interactive games and simulations. The deep learning and neural network techniques are used to teach the car
how to navigate the environment, recognize obstacles, and make decisions based on real-time data from sensors.

The neural network is trained on a dataset of images and sensor readings captured from a real car, allowing
it to learn how to respond to different driving scenarios. Pygame is used to create a graphical user interface
that displays the car's view and allows the user to interact with the system. The project aims to demonstrate
the potential of machine learning and AI in the automotive industry by developing a self-driving car that can 
navigate complex environments and make decisions in real-time.
